## Overview
Gopher Platform Game is a simple yet fun 2D platform game featuring our beloved Gopher. The game is designed to explore the potential of WebAssembly in game development using Go.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.17+ installed on your machine.
- A modern web browser.

### Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gopher-platform-game.git
cd gopher-platform-game
```

## Build and Run

### Building the Game
To build the game, we use a Makefile. The Makefile handles compiling the Go code and setting up the WebAssembly environment.

```bash
make
```

This command will:
- Clean the project.
- Format the Go code.
- Download dependencies.
- Build the native Go project.
- Build the WebAssembly target.
- Copy the necessary assets to the output directory.

### Running the Game
Once built, you can run the game by serving the `dist` directory using a simple HTTP server. 

```bash
go run cmd/main.go
```

Now, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to play the game!
